## What is SDLC?
- `SDLC` stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**. It is a structured process followed by software development teams to `design`, `develop`, `test` and `deploy software systems` efficiently and with high quality.

### ‚úÖ Phases of SDLC
1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis.
   -
   - Understand what the users need
   - Gather functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Outcome: Requirements Specification Document.
  
2. Planning
   -
   - Define scope, resources, timelines, cost and risks.
   - Create a project plan.
  
3. Design
   -
   - Convert requirements into a blueprint.
   - Includes High-Level Design(HLD) and Low-Level Design(LLD).
   - Outcome: Design Documents, Architecture.
  
4. Development
   -
   - Actual coding of the software.
   - Developers build the system based on the design
  
5. Testing
   -
   - Verify that the software works as expected.
   - Types include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT)
  
6. Deployment
   -
   - Release the software to the production environment.
   - Can be a full rollout or in stages (beta release).
  
7. Maintenance
   -
   - Fix bugs, make improvements, update features.
   - Ongoing support for the software product.
  
### ‚úÖ Common SDLC Models
| Model         | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Waterfall** | Linear and sequential. Each phase must be completed before the next starts. |
| **Agile**     | Iterative and incremental. Work is delivered in sprints.                    |
| **V-Model**   | Testing is planned parallel to development.                                 |
| **Spiral**    | Combines design and prototyping in iterations. Focuses on risk analysis.    |
| **Iterative** | Develop a version, get feedback, and improve in cycles.                     |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### ‚úÖ Agile Model (Recommended)
#### üöÄ Why Agile is Suitable:
- Iterative Development: You deliver in small sprints (2‚Äì4 weeks), which allows for continuous feedback and improvement.
- Frequent Delivery: Working software is delivered frequently, giving the client quick visibility into progress.
- Client Collaboration: Agile emphasizes regular interaction with the client and stakeholders.
- Flexibility: You can adapt to changing requirements, which is common in real-world projects.


#### üìå When You Might Choose Other Models:
| Model         | When to Use                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Waterfall** | Fixed scope, one-time delivery, no scope for changes. Example: Government projects. |
| **V-Model**   | When testing is as critical as development (e.g., healthcare or aviation software). |
| **Spiral**    | High-risk projects needing heavy prototyping and risk analysis.                     |
| **Hybrid**    | Mix of Agile and Waterfall for large enterprises needing structure and agility.     |

#### üì¶ Typical Agile Stack in Java Full Stack Projects:
| Layer         | Tech Stack Example                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend      | React, Angular, or Vue                         |
| Backend       | Spring Boot / Spring MVC                       |
| Database      | MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB                   |
| CI/CD         | Jenkins, Docker, GitHub Actions                |
| Project Tools | JIRA (for Agile boards), Confluence, Bitbucket |
| Testing       | JUnit, Mockito, Selenium                       |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To calculate and manage the time required for a particular development task, developers and project teams in the IT industry typically use a combination of the following tools:
#### ‚úÖ 1. JIRA (by Atlassian) ‚Äì Most Common
##### üîß Used For:
- Time estimation (Story Points / Hours)
- Sprint planning and task breakdown
- Logging time spent (Time Tracking)
- Generating burndown charts, velocity reports

##### üìå How it Helps:
- You estimate time during sprint planning (Original Estimate)
- Log actual hours worked (Time Spent)
- Compare estimated vs actual time
- Monitor team performance over time

##### ‚úÖ Example in JIRA:
| Task           | Original Estimate | Time Spent | Remaining |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Build REST API | 6h                | 5h         | 1h        |
| React UI Form  | 4h                | 4h         | 0h        |
| Unit Tests     | 3h                | 2h         | 1h        |

##### üîç How to Estimate Time Effectively:
- Break tasks into small units (2‚Äì8 hours)
- Use experience and past sprint velocity
- Discuss with team during planning
- Apply buffers for review and rework
- Track actual time for future accuracy
