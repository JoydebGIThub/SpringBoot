# Spring boot and Java compatible version:
- If we use `Java 8 to 17` then Spring Boot version `2.7.x` is compatible. Actively maintained (Long-Term Support until Nov 2025).
- If we use spring boot version `3.x+` then we need to use `Java 17+` because **Java 8 unsupported not compatible with the version**.
